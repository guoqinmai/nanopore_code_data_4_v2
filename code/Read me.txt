Step 1:quality control, code:1_zhikong.sh

Step 2:removal of host contamination,code:2_suzhu.sh

Step 3:Compressed files,code:3_yasuo.sh

Step 4:Unzip files,code:4_jieya.sh

Step 5:converted from FASTQ format to FASTA format,code:5_fasta.sh

Step 6:aligned with the genome of pathogenic microorganisms using BLASTN software,code:6_blastn.sh

Step 7: calculating the parameters of the  pathogenic microorganism BLASTN results.
These parameters, including the number of matches, average, sum, reads_ratio, and all_sum, are related to the possible pathogenic microorganisms.
Therefore, they were multiplied to obtain the product, and the proportion of each product was calculated. The proportions of the products(all_ratio) are arranged in descending order. 

The sample with the highest proportion of the product(all_ratio) was considered the suspected pathogen of the sample.code:7_bingyuanjun_tongji.py

Step 8:aligned with the AMR (Antimicrobial Resistance,AMR) genes using BLASTN software,code:8_blastn_amr.sh

Step 9: calculating the parameters of the AMR BLASTN results.
These parameters, including the number of matches, average, sum, reads_ratio, and all_sum, are related to the possible AMR genes.
Therefore, they were multiplied to obtain the product, and the proportion of each product(all_ratio) was calculated. The proportions of the products are arranged in descending order. 

The sample with the highest proportion of the product(all_ratio) was considered the suspected AMR genes of the sample.code:9_bingyuanjun_tongji.py

You can run it step by step, or integrate it into one code to run automatically(run_automatically_scripts.sh). It should be noted that the sequence of automatically running code should not be changed.
